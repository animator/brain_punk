I had never seen anything like this before, maybe the symbols represent numbers.\nThe key was to find the three numbers at the bottom, but in order to do so I need to work out what numbers do these symbols represent. Each row and column adds up to a number, shown as another symbol at the end of each row or column.\nHurry up now! enter the 3 digit answer -",
